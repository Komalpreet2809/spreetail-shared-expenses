"""Create the demo user + the flatmate group with correct membership windows.

The membership dates encode the story given in the assignment:
  * Aisha, Rohan, Priya, Meera have been in the flat since February (no
    joined_on => "since the beginning").
  * Meera moved out at the end of March  -> left_on 2026-03-31.
  * Sam moved in mid-April               -> joined_on 2026-04-08.
  * Dev is a trip guest, never a standing member -> is_guest.
  * Kabir is intentionally NOT seeded: he appears once in the CSV and the
    importer discovers him as a one-off guest (a deliberate anomaly).

These windows are a *product decision* configured by the group owner; the CSV
notes informed the dates. See DECISIONS.md.
